# Weight Graph
Create a graph from your Noom export data.
This is a little vibe-coded page to upload your Noom weight data and get a graph of it. 
To use, request your data from Noom, and open up the .zip file they provide you with. Find the file called actions.csv and use the Browse button on the page to upload that file. 
Note that this will only load it in your browser, not sent it anywhere, and that file will not contain any personally identifying info anyway, you could open it up in Excel to check if you want. 
The page will great a graph, and you can then download it, it should go to your downloads folder. 
There you go!
